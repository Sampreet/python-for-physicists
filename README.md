> A complete series for programming in Python aimed to suffice simulation and visualization requirements in Physics.

*Python* is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose language supporting object-oriented programming with more emphasis on code-readibility and extensibility. 
It has a wide range of applications and is the backbone of widely-used scientific computing libraries like TensorFlow, and even stand-alone applications like Blender.

This series gradually traverses from basic to advanced topics of Python for numerical simulations, deriving analytical expressions and visualizing results pertaining to the area of physical sciences. 
These tutorials and their corresponding notebooks are clubbed into different modules based on the topics covered in the [modules folder](./modules/).

## Beginner-level Topics
---

The course starts with setting up Python with a brief introduction to the ecosystem and the development environment in [*Module 01 - Getting Started*](./modules/m01-getting-started/README.md). 
Next, the basic data-types of python as well as looping and function representations are covered in [*Module 02 - Fundamentals of Python*](./modules/m02-fundamentals-of-python/README.md).
[*Module 03 - Visualizing Data*](./modules/m03-visualizing-data/README.md) introduces the powerful library Matplotlib and [*Module 04 - Scientific Computing*](./modules/m04-scientific-computing/README.md) illustrates the working of numerical libraries Numpy and SciPy.
Finally, usage-oriented practices that speed up and help in debugging are hinted in [*Module 05 - Best Practices*](./modules/m05-best-practices/README.md).
The individual topics covered in this level are:

With the basics covered, the course jumps into a few more plotting and computational libraries in [*Module 03 - Visualizing Data*](./modules/m03-visualizing-data/README.md) and [*Module 04 - Scientific Computing*](./modules/m04-scientific-computing/README.md).
Next, [*Module 05 - Best Practices*](./modules/m05-best-practices/README.md) introduces object-oriented programming, exception handling and ways to parallelize the code.
[*Module 06 - Machine Learning*](./modules/m06-machine-learning/README.md) and [*Module 08 - Quantum Computing*](./modules/m08-quantum-computing/README.md)then highlights two rapidly growing areas, introducing crude learning paradigms and concepts pertaning to quantum computing.
