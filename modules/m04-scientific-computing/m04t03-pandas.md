# M04T03 - Pandas

[![Anaconda Latest Release](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas/)

> Shooting towards Data Science!

[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open-source Python library that offers analytical tools for datasets to import, clean and process them quickly.
Originally written in 2008, the name is arguably derived from *Panel Data*, or according to some, *Python Data Analysis Library*.
Its primary advantages include:

* Extremely streamlined for representing and interpreting of large data.
* Functions to calculate statistical measures, and to clean or filter data. 
* Supports Python's native data types as well as NumPy's data arrays.
* Import from and export to CSV, XLS, HTML, JSON, SQL databases. 

## Getting Started

`pandas` comes with the `anaconda` distribution and relevant commands to set it up can be found in the [package page](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas/).
It primarily works with data tables containing `DataFrame` objects.
