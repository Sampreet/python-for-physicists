# Neural Networks

> Doing it the brain's way!

The brain can be imagined as a framework acquiring information from the sense organs, processing it and coming up with a thought. 
On a microscopic level, this framework consists of pathways transfering electrical signals between nodes called neurons, which are connected to each other by edges and can be regarded as a network of activatable switches.

Artificial neural networks were designed to mimic this biological workflow of the brain. 
In the last decade, such networks have proved to be quite useful (and popular) in classifying images, in natural language processing as well as have displayed extra-ordinary results in certain competitive games.

In the area of physical sciences, neural networks are currently being used to predict and understand various properties of materials, detect and classify phases of matter as well as simulate trends of other quantum mechanical properties.
